## Vibrancy | 2015 | Lorella Camellina

#####Abstract

Vibrancy is an artistic tool, which aims to visually tell the vitality of a physical space. The place we are talking about is much more than a mere building. It is an historical convent hosting a brand new design school, in the heart of San Marino Citt√†. Vibrancy detects noise level and expresses it as a continuous dynamic flow of material. Perfect image of our daily academic life: always on the move.
