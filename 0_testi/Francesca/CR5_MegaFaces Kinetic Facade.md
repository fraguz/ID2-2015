###What is it?
#####Authors' description
MegaFaces is a cross-platform project that combines digital, sculptural and architectural innovation. It was conceived by London architect Asif Khan and engineered by iart for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The project was commissioned by the Russian telecom operator MegaFon.
Similar to a pin screen, the kinetic facade of the MegaFaces Pavilion was able to transform in three dimensions to recreate human faces. It displayed giant 3d-selfies of visitors to the building and sports fans from all over Russia and thus, gave everyone the opportunity to be the face of the Olympics. True to MegaFon's campaign: 'Create your own Olympic history'.

###How it works

#####The Façade
The kinetic façade measured 18 x 8 metres and consisted of 11,000 telescopic cylinders, so called actuators. The actuators could be controlled individually and carried at their tips a translucent sphere containing an RGB-LED. Each actuator acted as one pixel within the entire façade and could be extended by up to two metres as part of a three-dimensional shape or change colour as part of an image or video that was simultaneously displayed.

#####The Photo Boots
Facial impressions were created once every minute. They were relayed to the kinetic façade from scans made in 3d photo booths that were custom-developed by iart and installed within the building and in public locations across Russia. The photo booths captured five photographs at the same time from slightly different angles, thus making the scanning process simple and instantaneous.
A scaling and positioning algorithm developed by Scott Eaton transformed the faces on-the-fly (the system will take approximately one minute to calculate) considering day lighting, scale, rotation, form and additional colour. The processed facial models were then inserted into a timeline by iart's electronic scheduling system. Finally, the images were converted into control data and sent to the individual actuators. 

#####The display
An external system displayed participants' names on screens in front of the pavilion and sent them an SMS informing them of the time their faces would appear.
The resultant portraits appeared on the side of the building, three at a time, at 8 metres tall - a magnification of 3500% - for a period of 20 seconds each.
Users will be informed what time to expect their face on the wall. Each participant will also be emailed a personal 20-second video so they can relive the moment.

###What it could mean?
“For thousands of years people have used portraiture to record their history on the landscape, buildings and through public art. Selfies, emoticons, Facebook and FaceTime have become universal shorthand for communicating in the digital age. My instinct was to try and harness that immediacy in the form of sculpture, to turn the everyday moment into something epic” says its creator.
The work deals not only with digital, sculptural and architectural innovations, but also with people and  the concept on being on the move, always in change and popularity.


###What if? 
I think this installation cover all the steps I can imagine: it has an interaction with the user who takes the photo and get involved in it, it makes the user proud to be a part of it giving him a 20 seconds fame, the experience continues after the on site interaction because of the video it sends, it is perfectly engineered, monumental and also the meaning is well thought as it represents the actual society. The only what if that comes to my mind is ...it would had been realized in a smaller scale and with a more poetic meaning? Would it be as spectacular as it is now?
