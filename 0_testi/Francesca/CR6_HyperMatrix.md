###What is it?
#####Authors' description
Hyper-Matrix is a kinetic landscape installation created for the Hyundai Motor Group Exhibition Pavilion in Korea, the 2012 Yeosu EXPO site.

###How it works

The installation consists of a specially made huge steel construction to support thousands of stepper motors that control 320x320mm cubes that project out of the internal facade of the building. The foam cubes are mounted to actuators that move them forward and back by the steppers, creating patterns across the three-sided display. Comprised of what at first appear to be three blank white walls, Hyper-Matrix installation quickly comes to life as thousands of individual cubic units forming a field of pixels begin to move, pulsate, and form dynamic images across the room, creating infinite number of possibilities in the vertical, 180 degree, landscape. In addition, as the boxes are arranged at only 5mm narrow intervals, the wall can also be a nice moving screen for the images projected on to it.

###What it could mean?
The actual meaning is to show how good Hyundai is on engineering, a celebration of a forward vision the productor wants to convey. The show was divided in two parts: the first was only with cubes moving to draw shapes, while the second was a projection of a HD sequence. As most of the innovations comes from the military field, this installation is to be developed and declined under other lights. It has the power of a 3d geometric mass moving shifting to a smooth surface to project on. 

###What if? 
"Thousands of physical pixels in a 180ยบ vertical landscape!" This is the title of one of the review I read and this makes me wonder on how this could represent the final link chain on my work. From the 2d image world to the physical one.
