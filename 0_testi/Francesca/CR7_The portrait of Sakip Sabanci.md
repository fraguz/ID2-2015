###What is it?
#####Authors' description
"The portrait of Sakip Sabanci" is a multi-image work of some of the thousands of people, from all walks of life, whose paths crossed Sakip Sabanci's in some way. These are people who were supported by him, those who worked with him, and family members. 

####Client 
The work of art commissioned in 2011 by the Sabanci family to Kutluğ Ataman, Turkish filmmaker and contemporary artist, to commemorate the 10th year of prominent Turkish businessman and philanthropist Sakip Sabanci’s passing. It was opened to public viewing at the Sakip Sabanci Museum. 

###How it works

[Making of video](https://vimeo.com/95980157)

The work was sourced in China, the technical infrastructure made in Turkey by Larves Artware Solutions and took 3 years to create. It was created using the same LCD panels found in smart phones.
The Project consists of a driver card, a communication card and a control/administration software. 
The LCD driver card communicates with an advanced level computer, thus transferring the photograph data. 
The external industrial computer is connected to the communication cards of the subsystems via fiber cables. 
The communication card transfers data consisting of thousands of photographs to the driver cards to be viewed on the screens in random order and
at random intervals. 
The work comprises approximately 10,000 LCD panels, aligned in 144 modules, each consisting of sets of 64, stacked horizontally and vertically.
The shape of the work is adjustable to the exhibition space in which it is shown.
Although technologically advanced the creation of the work uses raw material that is essentially human.
Each LCD panel, which fades in and out, presents the tens of thousands of people who were connected to Mr Sabanci: the figures range from factory floor workers to his driver.

###What it could mean?
The work focuses on the “people first” philosophy of Sakip Sabanci, who valued and respected people regardless of their age, importance or stature, and makes visible all the windows Sakip Sabanci opened to life and people during his lifetime. 
The work aims at reflecting the personality of the leader, his innovativeness, his sharing and embracing nature, his overriding principle of always giving first priority to people. Throughout his life, Sakip Sabanci had many windows opening to life and people. 
Kutluğ Ataman’s work makes visible all the windows opened by Sakip Sabanci. The large suspended canvas, which looms large over the visitors, questions the idea of leadership and what makes the man.
The artist himself stated "I created a very large portrait but the very subject of the portrait is missing in the picture. Instead, there are images of nearly 30 thousand individuals that appear as no names. I think this opens up doors for new discussion, both in politics and art. However I don’t believe in messages. I believe in the experience and not the so-called message. I like asking these questions and inciting discussion and new thinking."

###What if? 
The most beautiful aspect of the work is that it can be disintegrate and reintegrate all its components in the form of another work. It can be reconstructed without disrupting its essence. 
The what if, this time, is: how about give a message in the meaning of the work itself, work with images, pixel to create a beyond what I see deeper meaning?
